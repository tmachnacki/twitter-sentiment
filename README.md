# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data Tracking Perceptions Over Time

This is a project completed for EECS 486: Information Retrieval at the University of Michigan in WN2022.

## Project Description

Companies are greatly interested in public perception of the business or its actions, particularly whether that perception is positive perception. We create a tool that quickly allows a company to judge just that, providing sentiment analysis on Tweets in a recent timespan. First, we train multiple models, using combinations of features and machine learning classifiers to find which give the best performance. We also create a web application that retrieves tweets matching a query in a time frame and use our classifier to provide the sentiments of the tweets, to inform company perception.

## Install
Dataset csv files can be found here (too large for github): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aWW3-CehYWi0IBcuLrmVAmb8UwjEByY2/view?usp=sharing

Use your favorite package manager to install the required packages. Here is an example using pip:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Machine Learning Instructions

#### Training
Train.py contains code that processed the Sentiment140 dataset for training, generates features using raw term frequency, tf-idf, and BERT embeddings, trains Naive-Bayes, Linear SVM, and Logistic classifiers, and then compares model performance using cross-validation. It also contains code to fine-tune a BERT-based Neural Network on the training data, but this code is never called as it takes significant computing power to train the model. The code will generate a plot containing cross-validation accuracy for the various combinations of models, using a sample of the training data, with n = 4000. The full training data is not used to limit the run time of the program. To alter the number of samples used for training, change the class_size variable at the beginning of main.py. This code will also generate a Naive-Bayes model that was trained using a larger portion of the data (n = 400,000) and twitter specific pre-processing that can be used as a benchmark in Test.py

To run the program from the command line:
```sh
$ python3 train.py
```

#### Testing
Test.py contains code to test the performance of a BERT based classifier, trained/implemented in the PySentimiento library [[1]](#1), which contains a sentiment analyzer trained on Twitter data [[2]](#1). Since we did not have the computing power necessary to fine-tune a full BERT based model, we are using a library implementation for domain-specific testing on the US Twitter Airline Sentiment Dataset. Since our project focuses on tracking perceptions of a specific company or product, we used a domain-specific dataset to model performance on Tweets about a specific topic. This will generate a performance report for the BERT based model, as well as the Naive-Bayes model generated in the previous part as a baseline for model performance on topic-specific Tweets outside of the training domain.

To run the program from the command line:
```sh
$ python3 test.py
```


### Web app instructions

Do the following commands in the command line from the root directory:

```sh
$ cd app/
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/Scripts/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ export FLASK_ENV=development 
$ flask run
```

You will also need to add a Twitter API token (key). Put the following in a file called "twitter_api_keys.json". This file should be in the tsa directory: twitter-setiment/tsa/twitter_api_keys.json
```
{
    "eecs486-project": {
        "bearer_token": "<your token here>"
    }
}
```

The app should now be running on localhost! Go to the IP given on the command line in
your browser to use the app, where you can input a query, date range, and number
of tweets per day to analyze and see graphs with useful information.
